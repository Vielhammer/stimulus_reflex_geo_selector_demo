# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version 3.0.0

* Rails version 6.1.1

* Make sure to run db:seed

* **Please note**: I only built out the subregions for Africa and the countries for Central Africa. I like data as much as the next person, but this is strictly for demonstration purposes of how to connect to models so I stopped there.
